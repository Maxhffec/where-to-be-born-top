🎈🎈🎈This is my attempt to create 'where-to-be-born' top, that measures the level of the life in different countries.I tried to take into account as many variables as possible.🎈🎈🎈
--
🎉🎉🎉1)To do it, I downloaded some data from Kaggle.com, and other data I obtained using web scraping. 🎉🎉🎉
--
🎁🎁🎁2)Then I used SQL to join tables into one big table and made some modifications to some tables, also removing the information that I didn't need.🎁🎁🎁
--
🎄🎄🎄3)To calculate the total score, I used Python in Jupyter Notebook. I used my own formula, giving preference to certain variables more than others. 🎄🎄🎄
--
🎲🎲🎲4)Finally, I put it into Tableau and obtained this visualization. 🎲🎲🎲
--
🐼🐼🐼5)I was particularly interested in which variables had the biggest impact on the top, so I returned to Jupyter to conduct some analysis using linear regression to see which variables had the most impact. That's all! I hope you have read everything :) I have more examples of projects on GitHub. I am only starting out, but I really like it.🐼🐼🐼
